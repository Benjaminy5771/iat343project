      STORY SUMMARY<br><br>
      Set in the year 2090, due to global warming, the survival of penguins is under threat. Glaciers have been melting 
      continuously, and the sun's rays are growing stronger, transforming the glaciers into the open sea. One penguin must 
      tirelessly search for the last remaining untouched glacier to survive. At this critical moment, a group of 
      friendly marine creatures, dolphins, emerges around the struggling penguin. They empathize with the penguin's 
      plight and are determined to help it find the last glimmer of hope - an unmelted glacier. Together, they navigate 
      the vast ocean, seeking out a patch of solid ice to shield the penguin from the scorching sun. In the end, after 
      a long and arduous journey, the penguin hops onto the back of a dolphin. Together, they make a startling discovery. 
      They repeatedly encounter human debris left behind on the continent - items like cardboard boxes, plastic bags, 
      stationery pouches, and more. This waste poses a massive threat to nature, exacerbating the deterioration of global warming. 
      Through this story, we aim to raise awareness about global warming and environmental protection. 
      We urge everyone to join hands in reducing pollution and safeguarding our beautiful and precious planet.<br><br>
      EXT. OCEAN - DAY<br><br>

      A dolphin glides gracefully through the water, passing many ice 
      floes on the verge of breaking. As it moves forward, it spots a 
      penguin standing on one of the precarious ice pieces.<br><br>
      
      CUT TO:<br><br>
      
      The penguin stands on a small ice floe, and the dolphin senses the danger.<br><br>
      
      CUT TO:<br><br>
      
      The dolphin uses its fin to signal the penguin to follow, 
      then guides it to a larger, intact ice floe.<br><br>
      
      BACK TO:<br><br>
      
      The penguin stands on the ice, locking eyes with the dolphin. 
      The dolphin extends its fin, as if inquiring if there's more safe ice ahead.<br><br>
      
      DOLLY IN:<br><br>
      Understanding the penguin's signal, the penguin sits on 
      the dolphin's back, and together they swim forward in search of unbroken ice.<br><br>
      
      
      EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT<br><br>
      
      Dolly in:<br><br>
      
      Under the beacon of a lighthouse, the penguin witnesses melting 
      icebergs, submerged houses, and the sun appearing even brighter at sunset.<br><br>
      
      CUT TO:<br><br>
      
      The dolphin and penguin come across a small section of the massive 
      iceberg, but it's insufficient for the penguin to sustain itself. The dolphin
       carefully positions the penguin on the nearby ice and then dives into the sea 
       to assist in maneuvering the iceberg.<br><br>
      
      
      CUT TO:<br><br>
      The dolphin struggles to push the entire iceberg up, but it's a formidable 
      task alone. A manatee-like mermaid emerges from the depths to help. After 
      the iceberg is in position, the mermaid gracefully swims away.<br><br>
      
      EXT. OCEAN - DAY<br><br>
      
      BACK TO:<br><br>
      
      The dolphin places the penguin on the prepared iceberg. 
      The dolphin and penguin glance back at the manatee-like mermaid as 
      a gesture of thanks.<br><br>
      
      DOLLY IN:<br><br>
      
      The dolphin and penguin look towards the manatee-like
       mermaid sitting on a distant heap of trash, deep in 
       contemplation.<br><br>
