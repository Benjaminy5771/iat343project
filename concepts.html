  <p><strong>Setting:</strong><br>South pole:<br>
  The penguin's home, south pole, the main location of the setting. 
  The south pole at the beginning is cold and full of icebergs. Environmental 
  pollution occurs more and more wastes appears on water, the temperature is 
  increasing as the sun gets brighter, and icebergs break into pieces and some 
  falls into the water and disappear. Less and less floating icebergs to rest on, 
  and the characters swimming in the ocean searching for a new home. While searching,
  garbage wastes are floating throughout the way. The light source is the 
  natural skylight and the sun. Overall, the setting mainly contains white 
  icebergs, the blue ocean, some wastes showing, and the blue and foggy sky 
  with the sun on top. </p>

        <p> <strong>Name:</strong> Manatee<br>
          <strong>Age:</strong> unknown<br>
          <strong>Appearance:</strong> looks like a mermaid, and constructed from garbage. 
          Sea grass is replaced with plastic waste on its head to resemble
           the hair of a mermaid. <br>
           <strong>Personality:</strong> unknown<br>
           <strong>Background:</strong> Mystery creature. In the end, she sits on a pile of trash,
          deep in contemplation. This likely carries two layers of meaning: first, 
          the excessive embellishment of the ocean by humans; superficially appearing
          as a mermaid, but in reality, the mermaid might have been swallowed by 
          the garbage. The second layer implies that if no action is taken soon, 
          it will be humans themselves sitting atop the garbage mountain.<br>
          <strong>The allusion of the manatee:</strong> The manatee is a creature resembling 
          a dugong. It's called a mermaid because when it surfaces with sea 
          grass on its head, it looks somewhat human. Therefore, in its depiction, 
          this term is borrowed. Sea grass is replaced with plastic waste on its head 
          to resemble the hair of a mermaid.
