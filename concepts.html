  The south pole at the beginning is cold and full of icebergs. Environmental 
  pollution occurs more and more wastes appears on water, the temperature is 
  increasing as the sun gets brighter, and icebergs break into pieces and some 
  falls into the water and disappear. Less and less floating icebergs to rest on, 
  and the characters swimming in the ocean searching for a new home. While searching,
  garbage wastes are floating throughout the way. The light source is the 
  natural skylight and the sun. Overall, the setting mainly contains white 
  icebergs, the blue ocean, some wastes showing, and the blue and foggy sky 
  with the sun on top. </p>

           <strong>Background:</strong> Mystery creature. In the end, she sits on a pile of trash,
          deep in contemplation. This likely carries two layers of meaning: first, 
          the excessive embellishment of the ocean by humans; superficially appearing
          as a mermaid, but in reality, the mermaid might have been swallowed by 
          the garbage. The second layer implies that if no action is taken soon, 
          it will be humans themselves sitting atop the garbage mountain.<br>
          <strong>The allusion of the manatee:</strong> The manatee is a creature resembling 
          a dugong. It's called a mermaid because when it surfaces with sea 
          grass on its head, it looks somewhat human. Therefore, in its depiction, 
          this term is borrowed. Sea grass is replaced with plastic waste on its head 
          to resemble the hair of a mermaid.

          audiences, making him an instant favorite.<br>
          <strong>Background</strong>: Penguin's origins are shrouded in mystery, but her 
          life truly began in the heart of the ocean, a realm of carefree 
          exploration and joyful camaraderie with other penguins and marine 
          companions. However, as the glaciers started to melt and the world 
          warmed, the idyllic habitat of Penguin began to vanish. The once-pristine 
          environment was now tainted with garbage, a stark contrast to the 
          purity of his youth. The places Penguin once played in grew scarcer, 
          and her beloved home was on the brink of disappearing entirely. 
          This perilous situation forced Penguin to become a nomad, constantly 
          seeking new safe havens, as her home was always in danger.  </p>

              <strong>Name</strong> Manatee-like mermaid<br> 
              <strong>Age</strong>: 45 years<br> 
              <strong>Personality</strong>: Dugong, resembling a manatee, is dubbed a mermaid 
              for its human-like appearance above water. Its visage serves as 
              a poignant testament to environmental degradation, featuring plastic 
              waste as its hair, a bag repurposed as a hat, electronic remnants 
              on its hands, and a tail adorned with worn-out shoes, bearing witness 
              to the toll of human interference. He is a helpful and kind.<br> 
              <strong>Background</strong>: Manatee, our third character, was born in this ocean 
              and thrived for 45 years. In his early years, he lived carefree days, 
              frolicking with dolphins and penguins. With time, he matured and faced 
              the challenges of middle age. However, as global warming intensified and 
              the ocean became inundated with debris, his once-pristine body now 
              bears the burden of accumulated garbage, a stark contrast to his 
              youthful innocence.
