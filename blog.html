    Week 14 - Dec. 19th<br>
    Ben enhanced the realism of the penguin animations. Yujia and Ben meticulously refined each animation in the scene, followed by rendering and editing.<br><br>

    Week 13 - Dec. 10th<br>
    Each team member modeled, animated, and rendered their assigned scenes for the video. Yujia and Joanna sourced sound effects, 
    while Ben assembled the rough cut of the final video.<br><br>

    Week 12 - Dec. 3rd<br>
    After receiving feedback, we discussed various animation techniques and issues with Rohan and Meehae. Ben and Yujia revisited the 
    script to streamline it, maintaining clarity while reducing some scenes. Ben improved the iceberg and ocean environments. 
    Joanna enhanced the manatee's texture, and Yujia began animating its swimming movements.<br><br>

    Week 11 - Nov. 30th<br>
    Our 3D animatic was due this week. We adhered to the timeline, practicing scenes according to the script, and faced the challenges of depicting visual effects.<br><br>

    Week 10 - Nov. 26th<br>
    Yujia and Joanna worked on the whale's textures, while Ben and Danny focused on the penguin. Both Ben and Yujia continued animating.<br><br>

    Week 9 - Nov. 19th<br>
    Each team member animated and rendered their individual scenes for the second, dynamic animatic, which were then compiled by Ben.<br><br>

    Week 8 - Nov. 12th<br>
    This week, we maintained steady progress on our respective tasks, occasionally swapping roles to assist with fine-tuning models, rigs, animations, etc.<br><br>

    Week 7 - Nov. 5th<br>
    Danny further refined the penguin model and began creating background dinosaur models. Ben developed additional environmental assets. 
    Together, Ben and Yujia strategized on using camera movements and angles for visual effects. Yujia initiated the hand-painted textures for the whale, 
    and together with Ben and Joanna, they started setting up and practicing camera angles and lighting for the rough 3D animatic, along with beginning the rigging process.<br><br>

    Week 6 - Oct. 23rd<br>
    Yujia completed the first iteration of the storyboard, including rough camera angles and sound effects. Joanna recorded the sounds to match the storyboard 
    images, made adjustments to the video before rendering, and submitted it. Ben uploaded the content to our website. Meanwhile, we divided our modeling tasks: 
    Yujia focused on the whale, Danny on the penguin, Joanna on the manatee, and Ben on all environmental elements.<br><br>

    Week 5 - Oct. 16th<br>
    Yujia persisted in developing the storyboard, carefully planning each shot. Ben provided feedback on the script to resolve any ambiguous shots and ensure a clear narrative.<br><br>

    Week 4 - Oct. 9th<br>
    Yujia began drawing the storyboard, and Ben started creating our project website.<br><br>

    Week 3 - Sept. 24th<br>
    For our final assignment, we aimed to create a project highlighting the importance of ocean conservation. 
    Yujia drafted several script options, focusing on plot development and comedic timing. Ben began designing the website. 
    Joanna and Danny contributed by researching penguins and whales, drawing inspiration from real-life and animated versions.<br><br>

    Week 2 - Sept. 17th<br>
    In our second week, the animation team came together. We brainstormed various topics and eventually decided on a theme centering around global 
    warming and its impact on penguins and their reliance on icebergs.<br><br>
