   <p>"Helpless Ocean" is our short animation, narrates the poignant journey of a penguin returning
      home, set against the backdrop of the South Pole. This setting was deliberately chosen to
      highlight the profound impacts of climate change, particularly on the icebergs that form a critical
      habitat for many polar species. The rapidly melting icebergs, a direct consequence of escalating
      temperatures, underscore the urgent crisis facing these animals who struggle to find new homes
      in a swiftly changing environment.<br><br><br><br>
      In the year 2090, due to global warming, the survival of penguins is under threat. Glaciers
      have been melting continuously, and the sun's rays are growing stronger, transforming the
      glaciers into the open sea. One penguin must tirelessly search for the last remaining untouched
      glacier to survive. At this critical moment, a group of friendly marine creatures, dolphins,
      emerges around the struggling penguin. They empathize with the penguin's plight and are
      determined to help it find the last glimmer of hope - an unmelted glacier. Together, they navigate
      the vast ocean, seeking a solid ice patch to shield the penguin from the scorching sun. After a
      long and arduous journey, the penguin hops onto a dolphin's back. Together, they make a
      startling discovery. They repeatedly encounter human debris left behind on the continent - items
      like cardboard boxes, plastic bags, stationery pouches, and more. This waste poses a massive
      threat to nature, exacerbating the deterioration of global warming. This story aims to raise
      awareness about global warming and environmental protection. We urge everyone to join hands
      in reducing pollution and safeguarding our beautiful and precious planet.</p>
